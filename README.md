#capture-input

I'm exploring clojurescript and the ecosystem around it. I quite enjoy what I've learnt so far so I've decided to build a small game to further my progress and understanding.

The demonstration is showing that I'm able to listen for when the space, left and right key are and aren't being pressed.

##technology

- clojurescript
- om
- core.async


##lets see it

- clone the repo
- cd into the repo
- lein cljsbuild once
- python -m SimpleHTTPServer
- open up 127.0.0.1:8000 with your browser


I'm a total noob with om and core.async. I've opened this up so that others can learn from what I learnt to use.

##license?
